# AutoMountNext

A modernized mod for Owlcat's Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous that provides automatic mounting for animal companions with both manual controls and combat automation.

Based on AutoMount_for_TabletopTweaks (https://github.com/DarthParametric/AutoMount_for_TabletopTweaks)

## Overview

AutoMountNext (v2.0.0) is a an alternative take on the original AutoMount mod, offering mount management that adapts to combat and exploration. The mod provides both immediate manual control and automation.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Individual Character Control
- **Per-Character Automation**: Each party member can have their own mounting preferences
- **Combat Mount Toggle**: Characters can automatically mount when combat begins
- **Post-Combat Mount Toggle**: Characters can automatically mount after combat ends
- **Visual Feedback**: Active preferences shown as toggable ability with clear descriptions

### âš¡ Emergency Manual Controls
- **Ctrl+Shift+A**: Instantly mount all party members (overrides individual preferences)
- **Ctrl+Shift+D**: Instantly dismount all party members (essential for cutscenes and restricted areas)

### ðŸ§  Smart Area Detection
- **Dynamic Area Awareness**: Automatically detects problematic areas where mounts should be disabled
- **Pet Safety System**: Uses the game's etude system to prevent mounts in incompatible zones
- **Cutscene Handling**: use emergency dismount to ensure compatibility with story sequences

### ðŸ”§ Other Compatibility
- **TabletopTweaks Integration**: Support for Undersized Mount feat (same-size mounting)
- **Multilingual Support**: Translations for all officially supported game languages

## How It Works

### Buff-Based Preference System
The mod uses the game's buff system to store and display mounting preferences. When you toggle a character's combat mounting abilities, hidden buffs are applied on their character that drives the automation.

### Safe Combat Integration
Combat automation uses a delayed-execution system that schedules mount/dismount operations safely, avoiding conflicts with the game's event system during intense combat scenarios.

### Embedded Resource Management
All mod assets are compiled directly into the DLL using embedded resources, ensuring clean deployment and eliminating external file dependencies.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Unity Mod Manager installed
2. Extract AutoMountNext to your `Mods/` directory
4. Configure your preferences via the in-game ModMenu settings

## Usage

### Setting Up Automation

2. Look for the new "Auto Mount When In Combat" and "Auto Mount When Not In Combat" abilities
3. Toggle these abilities to set each character's preferences
